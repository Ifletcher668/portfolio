    Weald & Woe is a Castle Metal band sighend to Fiadh Productions. We combine
    the majesty of the medieval era with the ferocity of classic black metal,
    evoking stories of the past to provide a contemporary soundtrack for those
    undertaking the quest to forge their own kingdom. Swords not optional.
