  <p>
    Since I was 12, I've dedicated my life to drumming, evolving from a
    passionate beginner to a professional touring musician. I currently play in
    two Extreme Metal bands, both of which are based in Boise, Idaho, and
    regularly tour the Pacific Nortwest and Southwest. We're working on
    expanding our reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2021, I began offering drum lessons to share my expertise and love for
    music. My focus is on technique, posture, and musical expression, aiming to
    build a solid foundation for students of all levels.
  </p>
  <h4>Lesson Overview</h4>

    <li>
      <b>Technique Mastery:</b> I teach everything from fundamental grip and stroke
      techniques to advanced rhythmic patterns, ensuring a comprehensive skill set
      for progression.

      <b>Posture Perfection:</b> Emphasizing the importance of proper posture to
      prevent injuries and promote efficient playing.
    </li>

      and expression through music, enhancing their personal connection to their
      playing. Studio and Scheduling

  <h4>My Bands</h4>
  <p>
    I play in two Extreme Metal bands, Weald and Woe, and Aterrima. Both bands
    offer different challenges to me. One, from a composition and technical
    complexity standpoint, and the other because I try to be as precise and
    powerful as possible.
