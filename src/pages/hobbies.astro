The story—or, rather, stories—interleave philosophy, poetry, and text-book-esque prose in a way that made me strive to be a better person. Yes, it's fiction. But in the words of Tom Spanbaur: Fiction is the lie that tells the truth truer.",

    <p>
      I love narrative. It <em>excites me</em> to sink my teeth into the flesh of
      a different world. From Dungeons & Dragons to copious video games, anime to
      books, it's how I've come to even perceive our own world: a story in which
      I am one of trillions of characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unashamedly, I love Medieval Fantasy over everything else. Whether that's
      the narratives I consume, or Renaissance Fairs (yes, I cosplay a fantasy
      character. Come at me), I yearn to live as if it were all real. Of course,
      modernity has its perks. I am a software engineer. I know full well video
      games wouldn't have existed if it weren't for progress. Yet that's the
      beauty of the modern age! Our choices are near-limitless.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not writing or reading fantasy stories, coding or working out at
      the gym, I'm writing poetry. I will publish more in the future, but here
      are are few to taste:
