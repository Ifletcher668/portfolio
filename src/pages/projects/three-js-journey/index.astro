  <p>
    I'm learning ThreeJS, and with it, webgl. This is an index of little
    projects I've done to learn. I'll keep adding to this as I go along, but
    here's what I have so far:
  </p>
  <ul class="simple-list">
    {
      THREE_JS_JOURNEY_LINKS_ARRAY.map((project) => {
        return (
          <li>
            <a href={project.href}>{project.title}</a>
          </li>
        );
      })
    }
  </ul>
</Layout>
